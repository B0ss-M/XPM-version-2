# Documentation

This folder contains supplementary documentation for using the XPM tools.

- [Drum vs Instrument Keygroups](drum_vs_instrument_keygroups.md) â€“ explains key differences and provides guidelines for generating drum kits and instruments.
- The `--verify-map` feature of `batch_program_editor.py` automatically assigns any unreferenced samples to new keygroups using note names extracted from file names.

## Developer Reminder

When updating the code, confirm that any function signature changes are reflected in every file that calls that function. Refer to the [Development Notes](../README.md#development-notes) for more details.
