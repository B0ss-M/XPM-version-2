## Instrument ADSR Presets

The main GUI now includes built-in envelope presets for common instrument
categories (piano, pads, bells, bass, and more). When you build new programs
using the batch tools these presets are applied automatically so each instrument
starts with a musical attack, decay, sustain and release. You can still tweak
the envelopes manually after loading the program in your MPC.
