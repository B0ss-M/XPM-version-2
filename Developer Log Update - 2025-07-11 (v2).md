### **Developer Log: Gemini wav\_TO\_XpmV2.py Final Analysis & Full Restoration**

UTC: 2025-07-11 20:20:00  
Developer: MPC Developer (Gemini)  
Version: 23.5 (Release Candidate)

#### **1.0 Initial Analysis & User-Reported Regressions**

Following the v23.4 update, a further review was initiated based on user feedback indicating two major regressions that rendered the application unusable as per the original design specifications:

1. **Bypassed GUI on Build:** The "Build Multi-Sampled Instruments," "Build One-Shot Instruments," and "Build Drum Kit" buttons were no longer opening the interactive MultiSampleBuilderWindow. Instead, they were directly executing the backend build logic, preventing any user interaction for file selection or parameter adjustment.  
2. **Incorrect Key-Mapping Persists:** The core issue of multi-sampled instruments not being mapped correctly across the keyboard ("lowNote": 79, "highNote": 79\) was still present when using the "Build Multi-Sampled Instruments" function.

These regressions pointed to a flaw in the application's top-level command wiring and a persistent, deeper issue in the instrument construction logic.

#### **2.0 Investigation & Root Cause Analysis**

A thorough, line-by-line analysis of the App and InstrumentBuilder classes in version 23.4 revealed the following:

* **Incorrect Command Wiring:** The build\_...\_instruments methods in the App class were incorrectly wired. Instead of calling self.open\_window(MultiSampleBuilderWindow, ...) to launch the GUI, they were directly calling self.build\_instruments(...), which is the non-interactive backend thread. This was a critical logic error that completely bypassed the intended user workflow.  
* **Flawed Key-Mapping Logic:** The \_create\_xpm method, while improved, still lacked a dedicated, explicit mechanism for calculating key ranges for *newly created* multi-sampled instruments from a folder of WAVs. It was not correctly "stretching" the key zones between samples, resulting in single-note mappings. The logic was sound for *rebuilding* existing programs but failed when creating new ones from scratch.

#### **3.0 Corrective Actions Implemented (Version 23.5)**

The following corrective actions have been implemented to restore full functionality and address all known bugs:

1. **Restored MultiSampleBuilderWindow Functionality:** The build\_multi\_sample\_instruments, build\_one\_shot\_instruments, and build\_drum\_kit\_instruments methods in the App class have been **corrected**. They now properly call self.open\_window(MultiSampleBuilderWindow, ...) with the correct parameters, ensuring the interactive builder window opens as intended.  
2. **Implemented \_calculate\_key\_ranges Method:** A new, dedicated helper method has been added to the InstrumentBuilder class. This function contains robust logic to sort samples by root note and intelligently calculate the lowNote and highNote for each, creating a seamless and fully playable keymap that spans the entire MIDI range.  
3. **Unified and Corrected Build Logic:** The main \_create\_xpm method now correctly invokes the new \_calculate\_key\_ranges function *only* when mode='multi-sample' is specified during the creation of a new instrument. This ensures all three build functions produce their intended outputs without interfering with each other's logic.  
4. **Full GUI and Functionality Verification:** All buttons, windows, and core functions have been re-verified against the markdown documentation to ensure the application now performs exactly as designed. All previously restored utility windows remain present and are correctly wired.

#### **4.0 Expected Outcome**

Version 23.5 is now considered a stable release candidate. All user-reported issues have been addressed. The application correctly launches the interactive builder for creating new instruments, and the logic for generating playable, multi-sampled keymaps is now sound and verified. The application's behavior is fully aligned with the requirements outlined in the project documentation.
