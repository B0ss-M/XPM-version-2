Version: 23.7 (Stable Release)

1.0 Final Analysis & User-Reported Regressions

Following previous updates, a final review was initiated based on user feedback indicating critical regressions and persistent bugs:

Bypassed GUI on Build: The "Build..." buttons were not opening the interactive MultiSampleBuilderWindow, preventing user interaction.

Incorrect Key-Mapping: The "Build Multi-Sampled Instruments" function was failing to create playable keymaps.

Destructive Rebuilds: The rebuild logic did not preserve per-layer parameters such as Tune, Pan, and Loop settings.

Parsing Errors: The _parse_xpm_for_rebuild function was failing on certain valid XPM files, causing a "Could not parse mappings" error.

These issues pointed to flaws in the application's top-level command wiring, instrument construction logic, and parsing resilience.

2.0 Investigation & Root Cause Analysis

A thorough, line-by-line analysis of the App, InstrumentBuilder, and modular script classes revealed the following:

Incorrect Command Wiring: The build_..._instruments methods in the App class were incorrectly wired to call the backend thread directly, bypassing the GUI.

Flawed Key-Mapping Logic: The _create_xpm method lacked a dedicated mechanism for calculating key ranges for newly created multi-sampled instruments from a folder of WAVs.

Incomplete Parameter Parsing: The _parse_xpm_for_rebuild function was only extracting a minimal subset of data, ignoring most per-layer parameters. It also lacked robust error handling for missing optional tags within an <Instrument> block, causing it to fail on valid, but sparse, XPM files.

Outdated Modular Scripts: The multi_sample_builder.py script contained its own outdated and redundant build logic instead of delegating to the main, corrected engine.

3.0 Corrective Actions Implemented (Version 23.7)

The following corrective actions have been implemented to restore full functionality and address all known bugs:

Restored MultiSampleBuilderWindow Functionality: The build_multi_sample_instruments, build_one_shot_instruments, and build_drum_kit_instruments methods in the App class have been corrected. They now properly call self.open_window(MultiSampleBuilderWindow, ...) with the correct parameters, ensuring the interactive builder window opens as intended.

Implemented Intelligent Key-Range Calculation: A new, dedicated helper method, _calculate_key_ranges, has been added to the InstrumentBuilder class. This function contains robust logic to sort samples by root note and intelligently calculate the lowNote and highNote for each, creating a seamless and fully playable keymap.

Implemented Full Parameter Preservation & Resilient Parsing:

The _parse_xpm_for_rebuild function has been completely overhauled to be more resilient. It now correctly handles XPMs that may be missing optional tags (like LowNote or HighNote in a malformed file) and will no longer crash. It also reads and stores all critical per-layer parameters (defined in the LAYER_PARAMS_TO_PRESERVE constant) into the mapping dictionary.

The add_layer_parameters function has been rewritten to use these preserved parameters when writing the new XPM file, ensuring a non-destructive rebuild.

Refactored multi_sample_builder.py: This modular script has been completely updated. It no longer contains any build logic. It now serves exclusively as a GUI to group files and then delegates the entire build process to the main, centralized InstrumentBuilder instance, ensuring consistency and correctness.

Full GUI and Functionality Verification: All buttons, windows, and core functions have been re-verified against the markdown documentation to ensure the application now performs exactly as designed.

4.0 Expected Outcome

Version 23.7 is now considered a stable release. All user-reported issues have been addressed. The application correctly launches the interactive builder, the logic for generating playable keymaps is sound, the parsing logic is resilient, and the rebuild process is non-destructive. The application's behavior is fully aligned with the requirements outlined in the project documentation.
