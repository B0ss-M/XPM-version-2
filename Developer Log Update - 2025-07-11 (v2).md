1.0 Final Analysis & User-Reported Regressions

Following the v23.5 update, a final review was initiated based on user feedback indicating a critical regression that rendered a key feature unusable as per the original design specifications:

Bypassed GUI on Build: The "Build Multi-Sampled Instruments," "Build One-Shot Instruments," and "Build Drum Kit" buttons were no longer opening the interactive MultiSampleBuilderWindow. Instead, they were directly executing the backend build logic, preventing any user interaction for file selection or parameter adjustment.

Incorrect Key-Mapping Persists: The core issue of multi-sampled instruments not being mapped correctly across the keyboard ("lowNote": 79, "highNote": 79) was still present when using the "Build Multi-Sampled Instruments" function.

Destructive Rebuilds: A core design flaw was identified where the rebuild logic did not preserve per-layer parameters such as Tune, Pan, and Loop settings, effectively destroying the original program's sound design on rebuild.

These regressions pointed to a flaw in the application's top-level command wiring and a persistent, deeper issue in the instrument construction and parsing logic.

2.0 Investigation & Root Cause Analysis

A thorough, line-by-line analysis of the App and InstrumentBuilder classes revealed the following:

Incorrect Command Wiring: The build_..._instruments methods in the App class were incorrectly wired to call the backend thread directly, bypassing the GUI.

Flawed Key-Mapping Logic: The _create_xpm method lacked a dedicated, explicit mechanism for calculating key ranges for newly created multi-sampled instruments from a folder of WAVs. It was not correctly "stretching" the key zones between samples, resulting in single-note mappings. The logic was sound for rebuilding existing programs but failed when creating new ones from scratch.

Incomplete Parameter Parsing: The _parse_xpm_for_rebuild function was only extracting a minimal subset of data, ignoring most per-layer parameters. The add_layer_parameters function subsequently used hardcoded defaults, causing the loss of data.

3.0 Corrective Actions Implemented (Version 23.6)

The following corrective actions have been implemented to restore full functionality and address all known bugs:

Restored MultiSampleBuilderWindow Functionality: The build_multi_sample_instruments, build_one_shot_instruments, and build_drum_kit_instruments methods in the App class have been corrected. They now properly call self.open_window(MultiSampleBuilderWindow, ...) with the correct parameters, ensuring the interactive builder window opens as intended.

Implemented Intelligent Key-Range Calculation: A new, dedicated helper method, _calculate_key_ranges, has been added to the InstrumentBuilder class. This function contains robust logic to sort samples by root note and intelligently calculate the lowNote and highNote for each, creating a seamless and fully playable keymap that spans the entire MIDI range. This is now invoked correctly only when building new multi-sampled instruments.

Implemented Full Parameter Preservation:

The _parse_xpm_for_rebuild function has been completely overhauled to read and store all critical per-layer parameters (defined in the new LAYER_PARAMS_TO_PRESERVE constant) into the mapping dictionary.

The add_layer_parameters function has been rewritten to use these preserved parameters when writing the new XPM file, ensuring a non-destructive rebuild.

The logic in the SampleMappingEditorWindow has also been updated to use this new preservation-first engine.

Full GUI and Functionality Verification: All buttons, windows, and core functions have been re-verified against the markdown documentation to ensure the application now performs exactly as designed. All previously restored utility windows remain present and are correctly wired.

4.0 Expected Outcome

Version 23.6 is now considered a stable release. All user-reported issues have been addressed. The application correctly launches the interactive builder for creating new instruments, the logic for generating playable keymaps is sound, and the rebuild process is now non-destructive, faithfully preserving the user's original sound design. The application's behavior is fully aligned with the requirements outlined in the project documentation.
