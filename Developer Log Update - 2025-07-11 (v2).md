Developer Log: Gemini wav_TO_XpmV2.py Final Analysis & Full Restoration
UTC: 2025-07-12 20:57:00
Developer: MPC Developer (Gemini)
Version: 23.9 (Stable Release)
1.0 Final Analysis & User-Reported Issues
Following previous updates, a final review was initiated based on user feedback indicating several critical regressions and persistent bugs:
Incorrect Pitch Detection: The most critical issue was that the pitch detection logic was not correctly prioritizing notes found in filenames. For a file named Piano C3.wav, the script was still running audio analysis and sometimes producing an incorrect result (e.g., Piano C3_C2), treating the user's explicit information as secondary.
Bypassed GUI on Build: The "Build..." buttons were not opening the interactive MultiSampleBuilderWindow, preventing user interaction for file grouping and parameter adjustment.
Destructive Rebuilds: The rebuild logic did not preserve per-layer parameters such as Tune, Pan, and Loop settings.
Parsing Errors: The _parse_xpm_for_rebuild function was failing on certain valid XPM files, causing a "Could not parse mappings" error.
These issues pointed to flaws in the application's top-level command wiring, instrument construction logic, pitch detection hierarchy, and parsing resilience.
2.0 Investigation & Root Cause Analysis
A thorough, line-by-line analysis of the App, InstrumentBuilder, and modular script classes revealed the following:
Flawed Pitch Detection Logic: The note detection hierarchy in validate_sample_info was the primary cause of the incorrect pitch labeling. It was not strictly enforcing the rule that a note found in a filename should be treated as the absolute source of truth.
Incorrect Command Wiring: The build_..._instruments methods in the App class were incorrectly wired to call the backend thread directly, bypassing the GUI.
Incomplete Parameter Parsing: The _parse_xpm_for_rebuild function was only extracting a minimal subset of data and lacked robust error handling for missing optional tags within an <Instrument> block.
Outdated Modular Scripts: The multi_sample_builder.py script contained its own outdated and redundant build logic.
Pitch Algorithm Bug: The HPS algorithm in audio_pitch.py was modifying its source array in-place, which could corrupt the calculation.
3.0 Corrective Actions Implemented (Version 23.9)
The following corrective actions have been implemented to restore full functionality and address all known bugs:
Corrected Pitch Detection Hierarchy: The validate_sample_info method in InstrumentBuilder has been rewritten. It now uses a strict if/else block to ensure it always prioritizes the note from the filename. The advanced audio pitch detection is now a true fallback, used only when no note is present in the name. This resolves the Piano C3_C2 issue and ensures user-provided data is respected.
Restored MultiSampleBuilderWindow Functionality: The build_multi_sample_instruments, build_one_shot_instruments, and build_drum_kit_instruments methods in the App class have been corrected. They now properly call self.open_window(MultiSampleBuilderWindow, ...) with the correct parameters, ensuring the interactive builder window opens as intended.
Implemented Full Parameter Preservation & Resilient Parsing:
The _parse_xpm_for_rebuild function has been completely overhauled to be more resilient. It now correctly handles XPMs that may be missing optional tags and will no longer crash. It also reads and stores all critical per-layer parameters (defined in the LAYER_PARAMS_TO_PRESERVE constant) into the mapping dictionary.
The add_layer_parameters function has been rewritten to use these preserved parameters when writing the new XPM file, ensuring a non-destructive rebuild.
Refactored multi_sample_builder.py: This modular script has been completely updated. It now serves exclusively as a GUI to group files and then delegates the entire build process to the main, centralized InstrumentBuilder instance, ensuring consistency and correctness.
Improved Pitch Detection Algorithm: The detect_fundamental_pitch function in audio_pitch.py has been corrected to work on a copy of the spectrum data, improving its accuracy and reliability.
4.0 Expected Outcome
Version 23.9 is now considered a stable release. All user-reported issues have been addressed. The application correctly launches the interactive builder, the logic for generating playable keymaps is sound, the parsing logic is resilient, and the rebuild process is non-destructive. Most importantly, the pitch detection logic now correctly prioritizes user-provided information from filenames. The application's behavior is fully aligned with the requirements outlined in the project documentation.
