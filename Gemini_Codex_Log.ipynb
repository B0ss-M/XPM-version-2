    "    \"**Objective:** The user reported that the script was not correctly creating \\\"advanced\\\" XPM files. Even when \\\"advanced\\\" was selected in the UI, the output was still a \\\"legacy\\\" file, missing the full set of modern MPC parameters.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"**Analysis & Changes:**\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"1.  **Root Cause Identification:** I determined that the `batch_edit_programs` function was performing a superficial edit rather than a full rebuild of the XPM file. It was modifying existing tags but not fundamentally changing the program's structure from legacy to advanced. This meant that legacy programs remained legacy, and the advanced parameters were never added.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"2.  **Architectural Change:** I re-architected the core logic of the `batch_edit_programs` function. The old logic has been replaced with a new **Parse-and-Rebuild** process.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"3.  **New Logic Flow:**\\n\",\n",
    "    \"    * **Parse:** The function now deeply parses the original XPM (legacy or modern) to extract its core sample mappings and all existing instrument parameters.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"    * **Rebuild:** It then constructs a new, clean XPM file from scratch, strictly adhering to the format (`advanced` or `legacy`) selected by the user in the UI.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"    * **Apply:** All user-specified tweaks (ADSR, filters, etc.) and any preserved parameters from the original file are then written into this new, correctly structured program.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"**Outcome:** This change ensures that legacy programs are now properly **converted and upgraded** to modern advanced keygroup programs, receiving the full set of editable parameters. The user's selection in the UI will now be correctly reflected in the output file's structure and contents.\"\n",
