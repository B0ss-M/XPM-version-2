I. Gemini's Report & Findings

Objective: The user reported that the script was not correctly creating "advanced" XPM files. Even when "advanced" was selected in the UI, the output was still a "legacy" file, missing the full set of modern MPC parameters.

Analysis & Changes:

Root Cause Identification: I determined that the batch_edit_programs function was performing a superficial edit rather than a full rebuild of the XPM file. It was modifying existing tags but not fundamentally changing the program's structure from legacy to advanced. This meant that legacy programs remained legacy, and the advanced parameters were never added.

Architectural Change: I re-architected the core logic of the batch_edit_programs function. The old logic has been replaced with a new Parse-and-Rebuild process.

New Logic Flow:

Parse: The function now deeply parses the original XPM (legacy or modern) to extract its core sample mappings and all existing instrument parameters.

Rebuild: It then constructs a new, clean XPM file from scratch, strictly adhering to the format (advanced or legacy) selected by the user in the UI.

Apply: All user-specified tweaks (ADSR, filters, etc.) and any preserved parameters from the original file are then written into this new, correctly structured program.

Outcome: This change ensures that legacy programs are now properly converted and upgraded to modern advanced keygroup programs, receiving the full set of editable parameters. The user's selection in the UI will now be correctly reflected in the output file's structure and contents.

I. Gemini's Report & Findings

Objective: Implement a dedicated "Advanced" tab within the BatchProgramEditorWindow to expose the newly supported sound design parameters.

Analysis & Changes:

UI Restructuring: I modified the BatchProgramEditorWindow to use a ttk.Notebook widget, creating a tabbed interface with "Basic" and "Advanced" tabs.

Parameter Relocation: Basic controls (Creative Mode, Volume ADSR, Mod Matrix) were kept on the "Basic" tab for quick access.

New "Advanced" Tab: The new tab was populated with organized controls for:

Filter ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release)

Filter Envelope Amount

Velocity Modulation (to Level, Attack, and Sample Start)

LFO 1 (Rate and Shape)

Backend Integration: The apply_edits method was updated to gather all values from both tabs into a single params dictionary. The batch_edit_programs function was subsequently modified to accept this dictionary, allowing it to apply any combination of basic and advanced parameters during the XPM rebuild process.

Outcome: The user now has a clean, intuitive interface for accessing the full suite of keygroup parameters. The separation of basic and advanced controls enhances usability, while the backend ensures all selected tweaks are correctly applied during the robust rebuild process.

I. Gemini's Report & Findings

Objective: Correct a GUI layout bug where the new "Quick Edits" section was not visible.

Analysis & Changes:

Root Cause Identification: The ttk.LabelFrame for the "Advanced Tools" section, located directly above the "Quick Edits" frame, was configured with sticky="nsew". This caused it to expand and consume all available vertical space in the main window, pushing the "Quick Edits" frame and all subsequent UI elements out of view.

Correction: I modified the layout configuration for the "Advanced Tools" frame, changing its sticky property from "nsew" (North, South, East, West) to "ew" (East, West).

Outcome: The "Advanced Tools" frame now only expands horizontally, occupying only the vertical space it requires. This allows the "Quick Edits" frame and all other UI elements below it to be rendered correctly and visibly within the application window.
