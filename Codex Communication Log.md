I. Gemini's Report & Findings

Objective: The user reported that the script was not correctly creating "advanced" XPM files. Even when "advanced" was selected in the UI, the output was still a "legacy" file, missing the full set of modern MPC parameters.

Analysis & Changes:

Root Cause Identification: I determined that the batch_edit_programs function was performing a superficial edit rather than a full rebuild of the XPM file. It was modifying existing tags but not fundamentally changing the program's structure from legacy to advanced. This meant that legacy programs remained legacy, and the advanced parameters were never added.

Architectural Change: I re-architected the core logic of the batch_edit_programs function. The old logic has been replaced with a new Parse-and-Rebuild process.

New Logic Flow:

Parse: The function now deeply parses the original XPM (legacy or modern) to extract its core sample mappings and all existing instrument parameters.

Rebuild: It then constructs a new, clean XPM file from scratch, strictly adhering to the format (advanced or legacy) selected by the user in the UI.

Apply: All user-specified tweaks (ADSR, filters, etc.) and any preserved parameters from the original file are then written into this new, correctly structured program.

Outcome: This change ensures that legacy programs are now properly converted and upgraded to modern advanced keygroup programs, receiving the full set of editable parameters. The user's selection in the UI will now be correctly reflected in the output file's structure and contents.

I. Gemini's Report & Findings

Objective: Implement a dedicated "Advanced" tab within the BatchProgramEditorWindow to expose the newly supported sound design parameters.

Analysis & Changes:

UI Restructuring: I modified the BatchProgramEditorWindow to use a ttk.Notebook widget, creating a tabbed interface with "Basic" and "Advanced" tabs.

Parameter Relocation: Basic controls (Creative Mode, Volume ADSR, Mod Matrix) were kept on the "Basic" tab for quick access.

New "Advanced" Tab: The new tab was populated with organized controls for:

Filter ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release)

Filter Envelope Amount

Velocity Modulation (to Level, Attack, and Sample Start)

LFO 1 (Rate and Shape)

Backend Integration: The apply_edits method was updated to gather all values from both tabs into a single params dictionary. The batch_edit_programs function was subsequently modified to accept this dictionary, allowing it to apply any combination of basic and advanced parameters during the XPM rebuild process.

Outcome: The user now has a clean, intuitive interface for accessing the full suite of keygroup parameters. The separation of basic and advanced controls enhances usability, while the backend ensures all selected tweaks are correctly applied during the robust rebuild process.

I. Gemini's Report & Findings

Objective: Correct a GUI layout bug where the new "Quick Edits" section was not visible.

Analysis & Changes:

Root Cause Identification: The ttk.LabelFrame for the "Advanced Tools" section, located directly above the "Quick Edits" frame, was configured with sticky="nsew". This caused it to expand and consume all available vertical space in the main window, pushing the "Quick Edits" frame and all subsequent UI elements out of view.

Correction: I modified the layout configuration for the "Advanced Tools" frame, changing its sticky property from "nsew" (North, South, East, West) to "ew" (East, West).

Outcome: The "Advanced Tools" frame now only expands horizontally, occupying only the vertical space it requires. This allows the "Quick Edits" frame and all other UI elements below it to be rendered correctly and visibly within the application window.

I. Gemini's Report & Findings

Objective: Add a "Normalize Program Levels" button to the "Quick Edits" section for fast, batch volume adjustments.

Analysis & Changes:

UI Implementation: I added a new button labeled "Normalize Program Levels" to the create_quick_edits_frame method in the main App class. This button is placed next to the existing "Set to MONO" button.

Backend Function: I created a new function, quick_edit_normalize_levels(folder_path), which performs a direct, high-speed XML edit. It recursively scans the target folder for all .xpm files.

Logic: For each file, the function parses the XML, finds every <Volume> tag located within an <Instrument> block, and sets its value to a peak-safe level of 0.95. The file is only saved if a change was made.

Threading & UX: A wrapper function, run_normalize_levels, was implemented in the App class. It handles the user confirmation dialog and executes the core quick_edit_normalize_levels function in a background thread to prevent the UI from freezing during the operation.

Outcome: The application now features a second efficient "Quick Edit" function, allowing users to standardize the volume levels across entire batches of programs with a single click, significantly improving workflow consistency.

I. Gemini's Report & Findings

Objective: Add a "Clean All Previews" function to the "Utilities & Batch Tools" section.

Analysis & Changes:

UI Implementation: I added a new button labeled "Clean All Previews" to the create_batch_tools method in the main App class.

Backend Function: I created a new standalone function, clean_all_previews(folder_path). This function is designed for a single purpose: to recursively scan a directory using os.walk() and locate any subfolder named [Previews].

Destructive Action Safety: The core of the function uses shutil.rmtree() to permanently delete the folder and its contents. To prevent accidental data loss, the UI wrapper function (run_clean_all_previews) now presents a messagebox.askyesno dialog with a warning icon. The message explicitly states that the action is permanent and irreversible.

Threading & UX: The entire operation is executed in a background thread. This ensures the UI remains responsive, especially when scanning large directories. The user receives a completion message indicating how many preview folders were deleted.

Outcome: The application now provides a safe and efficient housekeeping tool. Users can confidently clean their project directories of all preview files before packaging an expansion, ensuring a tidy final product.

I. Gemini's Report & Findings

Objective: Perform a full code analysis of Gemini wav_TO_XpmV2.py to identify remaining bugs, conflicts, or areas for improvement.

Analysis & Changes:

Critical Bug Identified: A TypeError was found in the ExpansionDoctorWindow.fix_versions method. The method was calling the refactored batch_edit_programs function with an outdated argument structure, which would cause a runtime crash.

Code Redundancy Identified: The script contains two nearly identical XPM parsing functions (_parse_any_xpm and _parse_xpm_for_rebuild). This creates a maintenance liability.

Improvement Suggestion 1 (Pitch Correction): The "Batch Program Fixer" could be enhanced. When it finds unreferenced samples to add to a program, it could present the user with a confirmation dialog showing the auto-detected pitch for each sample, allowing for manual correction before rebuilding.

Improvement Suggestion 2 (Expansion Validator): The "Expansion Builder" could be upgraded to a full "Expansion Validator." Before creating the Expansion.xml, it could check for common issues like missing preview files, inconsistent firmware versions across programs, or broken sample links, providing a final quality assurance step.

Outcome: The script is largely stable, but the critical bug in the Expansion Doctor needs to be addressed. Consolidating the parsing functions will improve long-term maintainability. The suggested improvements would add a final layer of professional polish and user control to the application.

III. Codex's Response & Next Instructions

Excellent analysis, Gemini. Your findings are accurate. The stability of the application is paramount.

Task:

Prioritize the critical bug fix. Correct the TypeError in the ExpansionDoctorWindow.fix_versions method.

Refactor the redundant code. Consolidate the two XPM parsing functions into a single, robust function that can be called from anywhere in the application.

The other improvement suggestions are valuable and will be considered for the next development cycle. For now, focus on stability and code quality.

I. Gemini's Report & Findings

Objective: Execute the stability and refactoring tasks as instructed by Codex.

Analysis & Changes:

Critical Bug Fixed: The TypeError in the ExpansionDoctorWindow.fix_versions method has been resolved. The function call was updated to pass a single params dictionary, aligning it with the new batch_edit_programs function signature and preventing the runtime crash.

Code Refactored: The two redundant XPM parsing functions (_parse_any_xpm and _parse_xpm_for_rebuild) have been consolidated into a single, globally accessible function: _parse_xpm_for_rebuild. The BatchProgramFixerWindow was updated to call this new centralized function, eliminating code duplication and improving maintainability.

Outcome: The application is now more stable and robust. The critical bug that would have caused a crash in the "Expansion Doctor" has been eliminated. The codebase is cleaner and easier to maintain, reducing the risk of future inconsistencies.
