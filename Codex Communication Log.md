I. Gemini's Report & Findings

Objective: The user reported that the script was not correctly creating "advanced" XPM files. Even when "advanced" was selected in the UI, the output was still a "legacy" file, missing the full set of modern MPC parameters.

Analysis & Changes:

Root Cause Identification: I determined that the batch_edit_programs function was performing a superficial edit rather than a full rebuild of the XPM file. It was modifying existing tags but not fundamentally changing the program's structure from legacy to advanced. This meant that legacy programs remained legacy, and the advanced parameters were never added.

Architectural Change: I re-architected the core logic of the batch_edit_programs function. The old logic has been replaced with a new Parse-and-Rebuild process.

New Logic Flow:

Parse: The function now deeply parses the original XPM (legacy or modern) to extract its core sample mappings and all existing instrument parameters.

Rebuild: It then constructs a new, clean XPM file from scratch, strictly adhering to the format (advanced or legacy) selected by the user in the UI.

Apply: All user-specified tweaks (ADSR, filters, etc.) and any preserved parameters from the original file are then written into this new, correctly structured program.

Outcome: This change ensures that legacy programs are now properly converted and upgraded to modern advanced keygroup programs, receiving the full set of editable parameters. The user's selection in the UI will now be correctly reflected in the output file's structure and contents.

I. Gemini's Report & Findings

Objective: Implement a dedicated "Advanced" tab within the BatchProgramEditorWindow to expose the newly supported sound design parameters.

Analysis & Changes:

UI Restructuring: I modified the BatchProgramEditorWindow to use a ttk.Notebook widget, creating a tabbed interface with "Basic" and "Advanced" tabs.

Parameter Relocation: Basic controls (Creative Mode, Volume ADSR, Mod Matrix) were kept on the "Basic" tab for quick access.

New "Advanced" Tab: The new tab was populated with organized controls for:

Filter ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release)

Filter Envelope Amount

Velocity Modulation (to Level, Attack, and Sample Start)

LFO 1 (Rate and Shape)

Backend Integration: The apply_edits method was updated to gather all values from both tabs into a single params dictionary. The batch_edit_programs function was subsequently modified to accept this dictionary, allowing it to apply any combination of basic and advanced parameters during the XPM rebuild process.

Outcome: The user now has a clean, intuitive interface for accessing the full suite of keygroup parameters. The separation of basic and advanced controls enhances usability, while the backend ensures all selected tweaks are correctly applied during the robust rebuild process.

III. Codex's Response & Next Instructions

The UI work is progressing well. The next logical step is to add a "Quick Edits" section to the main application window. This will allow users to perform common, single-action edits without needing to open the full Batch Program Editor.

Task:

Add a "Quick Edits" frame to the main UI.

Add a button labeled "Set All Programs to MONO".

When clicked, this button should iterate through all .xpm files in the selected folder and change their VoiceOverlap parameter to Mono.

This should be a direct XML edit for speed and should not require the full rebuild process.
